			<p>This topic is so important because so many causes of deaths are due to bullying. 
				Bullying happens all over the world and mostly at school where people can be humiliated 
				and where more people can be invloved. We created this website because we want to send a mesage talking 
				about how bullying IS NOT COOL and so many people go through it alone!

			<p>This topic is so important because so many causes of deaths are due to bullying. People get bullied for lots of
				reasons but the top most reasons are because of the individuals race, sexuality, their appearence, types of people the
				individual hangs out with, their religion, and if they have special needs. Victims of bullying suffer of mental health issues like depression, 
				low self-esteem, anxiety and panic attacks when they confront or see the abuser. Schools don't consider it abuse so they don't do anything about 
				it unless there's witnesses, written or physical proof. Schools don't help instead they tell the victim "yeah... I could've done or said that"
				, just ignore it and put your head down, and tell them to stop. When they exactly know that it makes it worse because the victims feel alone
				and like if they just nother the people around them with it so instead they kill themselves. Also, teachers don't do anything 
				about it if witnessed because teh school district doesn't prepare or teach them how to dea with it or they're just afraid of getting fired by getting involved.
				These are just a few reasosn for why people 
				get bullied but the list goes on! Many poeple feel like when they get bullied they are alone
				but thats not the case AT ALL! So many poeple get bullied but they dont want to say something to someone because they are worried the bully will hurt them more. We have a voice for a reason! Speak up and help prevent bullying!</P>
