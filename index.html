			<P>This topic is so important because so many causes of deaths are due to bullying. Bullying happens all over the world and mostly at school where people can be humhumiliated and where more people can be invloved. we created this website because we want to send a mesage talking about how bullying IS NOT COOL and so many people dont go through it alone!<P>
