			<p>FACT:THRUEHTEURH</p>
			<P>This topic is so important because so many causes of deaths are due to bullying. Bullying happens all over the world and mostly at school where people can be humiliated and where more people can be invloved. we created this website because we want to send a mesage talking about how bullying IS NOT COOL and so many people don't go through it alone! People get bullied for lots of reasons but the top most reasons are because of the individuals race, sexuality, their appearence, types of people the individual hangs out with, their religion, if they have special needs. These are just a few reasosn for why people get bullied but the list goes on! Many poeple feel like when they get bullied they are alone but thats not the case AT ALL!</P>
