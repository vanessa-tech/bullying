			<p>FACT:THRUEHTEURH</p>
			<P>This topic is so important because so many causes of deaths are due to bullying. 
				Bullying happens all over the world and mostly at school where people can be humiliated 
				and where more people can be invloved. We created this website because we want to send a mesage talking 
				about how bullying IS NOT COOL and so many people go through it alone! People get bullied for lots of
				reasons but the top most reasons are because of the individuals race, sexuality, their appearence, types of people the
				individual hangs out with, their religion, and if they have special needs. These are just a few reasosn for why people 
				get bullied but the list goes on! Many poeple feel like when they get bullied they are alone
				but thats not the case AT ALL! So many poeple get bulliued but they dont want to say something to someone because they are worried the bully will hurt them more. we have a voice for a reason! Speak up and help prevent bullying! So what can you do if you get bullied?
			        There are things you can do if you are being bullied:

Look at the kid bullying you and tell him or her to stop in a calm, clear voice. You can also try to laugh it off. This works best if joking is easy for you. It could catch the kid bullying you off guard.
If speaking up seems too hard or not safe, walk away and stay away. Don’t fight back. Find an adult to stop the bullying on the spot.
There are things you can do to stay safe in the future, too.

Talk to an adult you trust. Don’t keep your feelings inside. Telling someone can help you feel less alone. They can help you make a plan to stop the bullying.
Stay away from places where bullying happens.
Stay near adults and other kids. Most bullying happens when adults aren’t around.</P>
