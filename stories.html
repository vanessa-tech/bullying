  <p>When I was in elementary/middle school, I was bullied for my appearance. Kids would say that I am "chubby" or "ugly" which really hurt.
    In my case, I was naive enough to let it all go and I could never say anything back. For me, it turned out fine becuase I never payed
    too much attention to it, I just tried to be friends with everyone. At one point in time, I just stoped caring and pushed that 
    negitivity away. However, I think that it is important that people stick up for themelves and are taught to do so. 
    It important that we learn to be civil even if we do not like the other person. I hope that the future is pluralistic...
    because where there is pluralism, there is change.

  <p>In 9th grade I was judged because I'd laughed a lot which made others think I was flirting with other guys. Also, I was body shamed and I was told 
    "You have an ugly body." Not only that I was called a "h**", "tranny" and "h*****". This affected my self-esteem, self-confidence, and made me
    insecure of myself.</p>
