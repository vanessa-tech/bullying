  <p>When I was in elementary/middle school, I was bullied for my appearance. Kids would say that I am "chubby" or "ugly" which really hurt.
    In my case, I was naive enough to let it all go and I could never say anything back. For me, it turned out fine becuase I never payed
    too much attention to it, I just tried to be friends with everyone. At one point in time, I just stoped caring and pushed that 
    negitivity away. However, I think that it is important that people stick up for themelves and are taught to do so. 
    It important that we learn to be civil even if we do not like the other person. I hope that the future is pluralistic...
    because where there is pluralism, there is change.

  <p>In 9th grade I was judged because I'd laughed a lot which made others think I was flirting with other guys. Also, I was body shamed and I was told 
    "You have an ugly body." Not only that I was called a "h**", "tranny" and "h*****". This affected my self-esteem, self-confidence, and made me
    insecure of myself.</p>

  <p>In middle school throughout highschool I was bullied and viewed as a slut and an attention whore, just because I would surround myself with guys. People would spread rumors about me saying things that I was pregnant, or I was cheating on my boyfriend or stupid stuff like that. I would try to ignore it but it just came back and happened more and more and more people got involoved. I would always tell myself that I wasn't worth anythjng and that I was an ugly person because I was surrounded by people that told me that stuff. But as time went by I knew that I woukd never see these people ever again and that this is highschool for me and I just had to get good grades and graduate and then these people wil mean notung to me in the furture.</p>

    <p> During the end of middle school and whole of high school I was bullied for all sorts of things such as my appearance, the way I was vocally, body shamed for being skinny, etc. I had gotten told that I needed to get "plastic surgery for my face","She looks like a monkey", "Sharky", "Hoe","Flat ass", and so many other names that I can't put my finger on right now. I moved passed all the stuff people have said about me. I feel like all my haters did all that verbal abuse to me because they wish they were somewhat like me, so more so just jealous of me. To me MY HATERS ARE MY MOTIVATORS!!! </p>
