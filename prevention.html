    <h3>There are things you can do if you are being bullied:  </h3>
				
				<p>* Look at the kid bullying you and tell him or her to stop in a calm, clear voice. 
					
					<p>* You can also try to laugh it off. This works best if joking is easy for you. It could catch the kid bullying you off guard.</P> 
<p>* If speaking up seems too hard or not safe, walk away and stay away. Don’t fight back. </P> 
	<p>* Find an adult to stop the bullying on the spot.</P> 

		<h3>There are things you can do to stay safe in the future, too.</h3>
  <p>* Talk to an adult you trust. Don’t keep your feelings inside. Telling someone can help you feel less alone. They can help you make a plan to stop the bullying.</P> 
<p>*Stay away from places where bullying happens. Stay near adults and other kids. Most bullying happens when adults aren’t around.</p>
